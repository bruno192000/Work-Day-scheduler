 <p> The scheduler has 9 containers where you can write your plan for the moment. The time is between 9am to 5 pm.
 Remember to press the small icon to save your plan. In the case you don't, all your plans will be gone.
 On the other hand is the styles, there's 3 different colors deppending of the current time you have. Gray is for plans that already past, Red for the current ones, and Green for the future.</p>
